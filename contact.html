        <p>The National Problem Gambling Helpline (1-800-522-4700) is available 24/7 and 
            is 100% confidential. This hotline connects callers to local health and 
            government organizations that can assist with their gambling addiction.</p>
        <p>As many as 10 million Americans live with a gambling addiction. The act of 
            gambling itself is not illegal in most situations, which can make it easier 
            for people to justify risky gambling behaviors. Unfortunately, most people 
            who have a gambling addiction donâ€™t see it as a problem. Gambling among college 
            students is on the rise. According to a combination of national studies, 1 in 20 
            college students meet the criteria for compulsive gambling. College student gambling 
            statistics indicate that the rate of compulsive gambling among college students is 
            more than double the rate of the overall adult population.</p>
