            <p>Slot machines contain random number generators that can generate 
                thousands of numbers per second, each of which is associated with
                 a different combination of symbols. Whether you win or lose is 
                 determined by the random number generated in the exact instant you 
                 activate each playâ€”if it matches a payline, you win. Modern slot machine 
                 outcomes are determined by a computer program called a random number generator. 
                 The symbols are really just for show. Every combination of slot machine symbols 
                 corresponds to a number. The random number generator program cycles through 
                 these numbers at a rate of thousands of times per second.</p>
